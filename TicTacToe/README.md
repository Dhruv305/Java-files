# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Java that you can play in the terminal. It's a two-player game where each player takes turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on the game board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Play against a friend in the same terminal window.
- A simple and intuitive text-based user interface.
- The game board is displayed in the terminal, making it easy to follow the game.
- Simple and clean codebase

## Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player must give input 'x y' format, where x and y range from 0-2.
- Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell of the grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
